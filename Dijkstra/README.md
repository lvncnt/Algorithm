# Compute the minimum number of cuts

The file, [`dijkstraData.txt`][1], contains the adjacency list representation of an undirected weighted graph with 200 vertices labeled 1 to 200. Each row consists of the node tuples that are adjacent to that particular vertex along with the length of that edge.

The program runs Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm on this graph, using the vertex 1 as the source vertex, and to compute the shortest-path distances between 1 and every other vertex *v* of the graph. If there is no path between a vertex *v* and vertex 1, the shortest-path distance between 1 and *v* is set to be 1000000. It will print the shortest-path distances to the following ten vertices: 7,37,59,82,99,115,133,165,188,197. 

Using the java clas: 
* Compilation: `javac *.java`
* Execution: `java Main dijkstraData.txt`
* Data file:
