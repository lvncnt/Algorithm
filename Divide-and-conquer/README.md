# Compute the number of inversions 

The file, `IntegerArray.txt`, This file contains all of the 100,000 integers between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive) in some order, with no integer repeated.

The program will compute the number of inversions in this file, where the ith row of the file indicates the ith entry of an array.
