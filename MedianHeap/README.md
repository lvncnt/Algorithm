This is the Programming Question - 6(II) from Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1. 

# Implement "Median Maintenance" algorithm 

The file, [`Median.txt`][1], a list of the integers from 1 to 10000 in unsorted order. Each row of the file represents an integer element.

The program runs heap-based implementations of the "Median Maintenance" algorithm: it reads files line by line and computes, at each time step the median of the number processed so far. For example, let `xi` denote the ith number of the file, then the kth median mk is defined as the median of the numbers `{x1,â€¦,xk}`. In the end, the sum of these 10000 medians are displayed.
