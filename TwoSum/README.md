This is the Programming Question - 6-I from Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1. 

# Implement 2-SUM algorithm 

The file, [`2sum.txt`][1], contains 1 million integers with repetitions. The ith row of the file represents the ith entry of the array.

The task is to compute the number of target values t in the interval [-10000,10000] (inclusive) such that there are distinct numbers x, y in the input file that satisfy x + y=t.
