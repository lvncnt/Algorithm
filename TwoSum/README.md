This is the Programming Question - 6(I) from Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1. 

# Implement 2-SUM algorithm 

The file, [`2sum.txt`][1], contains 1 million integers with repetitions. The ith row of the file represents the ith entry of the array.

The program returns the number of target values `t` in the interval `[-10000,10000] (inclusive)`, such that there are distinct numbers x, y in the input file that satisfy `x + y = t`.
